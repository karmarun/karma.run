## Introduction

karma.run ("karma" for short) is an integrated back-end server solution to power data-driven
client applications. It is designed to be easy to use directly from a web browser, IoT or mobile environment.

## Features

karma.run comes with batteries included and features such as:
 * nested data object models.
 * strong serializable consistency.
 * powerful ABAC-based access control.
 * a relational model with traversable reference graph.
 * functional, homoiconic query interface.

## Run Karma (Docker)

**create a secret key:**  
The secret is the auth key of the servers "admin" user. In order to run karma you need to generate a secret:

**Mac:**
```bash
head -c 1024 /dev/urandom | base64
```
**Linux:**
If you are on Linux use the base64 -w0 flag to strip the newlines out
```bash
head -c 1024 /dev/urandom | base64 -w0
```

pull the image 
```bash
docker pull karmarun/karma.run
```

run karma
```bash
docker run -d \
           -e "KARMA_DATA_FILE=/karma-run-db.data" \
           -e "KARMA_INSTANCE_SECRET=base 64 encoded secret key" \
           -p 8080:80 \
           karmarun/karma.run
```
